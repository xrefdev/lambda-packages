##Preperation

If you want the finished Pillow `3.1.1.tar.gz` and `test.zip` sent to a bucket after it is created, please set the `bucket` and `region` variables at the top of the script:

```

dir="pillow-build"
bucket="<YOUR BUCKET>"
region="<YOUR REGION>"

```
Optionally, you can also set a directory.
The EC2 instance will need the correct IAM role to perform this action.


##Build

Report from `pip install --verbose --use-wheel pillow`

```
